This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## File drive 

The project is essentially a file uploads system that explores a couple of interesting technologies

I use [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) a real time hosted backend solution that makes development and managing both the backend and underlying data management a breeze. 

I also integrated [Clerk(The most comprehensive User Management Platform)](https://clerk.com/) this is legit one of the best user management solutions that I've used. Makes authentication and other related user management a breeze.

In the process of connecting CLerk and Convex I also used [Svix](https://www.svix.com/) for the webhooks interaction between both platforms

For the User interface I used beautiful components from [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and of course [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for all the beautiful interface customizations.

It's only a dummy application that may not be fully featured yet, but deployment to production is ongoing on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and it would be available for user interaction fully [at this location](https://file-drive-murex.vercel.app/)
